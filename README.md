# Oasis-Data 

This project birthed during the [2023 Bordeaux Hackatech](https://hackatechbordeaux.inria.fr/) and whose goal is to provide medical researchers with a robust data management system.

This project relies on girder for the backend and react for the frontend. To start girder you also need a mongodb instance running.
